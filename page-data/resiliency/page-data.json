It is based on tests that were\nconducted on a sample application to determine when data might be lost or become inconsistent in\nan application system failure. To make tests realistic, the sample application is BlueCompute,\nwhich is based on a microservices architecture.\n\n- In this article, you get familiar with the basic concepts of resiliency that you must consider when\nyou develop an application to meet resiliency requirements. You learn about data persistency\noptions, the criteria to select technology for a data store, and typical application deployment\ntopologies to adopt for resiliency.\n- You’ll explore a few failure scenarios to understand resiliency pitfalls and the guidelines that\napplication developers should consider. In this context, developer is used to refer to a person who is\nas either a developer or designer of applications.\n\nRead the [full paper](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/files/HADR-for-apps-based-on-containers.pdf) from the [IBM Garage Architecture Center](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/resilience)\n\n## Part 2: High availability and disaster recovery for applications that are based on containers\n\n- This article is the second in a series that describes approaches and advice for developers and site\nreliability engineers to build resiliency for cloud-native applications.
