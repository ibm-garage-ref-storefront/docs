To achieve this, you must run the following steps:\n\n- Go on [cloud.ibm.com](cloud.ibm.com)\n\n- On the resource list, you should see a list of your clusters.\n\n- Once you have the cluster you want to work on, click on the Openshift web console. When you are on the Openshift web console, click on the box icon and go into Cloud Pak console. \n\n**See image below for reference**\n\n![Storefront](../../images/creating-webhook-step1.png) \n\nOnce you are inside the IBM Cloud Pak console, click on the second icon to access the * **Instances** * page. On the page inside the Pipeline box, click on the button * **Manage Pipelines** *\n\n![Storefront](../../images/creating-webhook-step2.png)\n\nGo to your Tekton Dashboard and click `Webhooks` as shown in Step 1. After you click on `Webhooks` you should be able to `Add Webhook` as shown in step 2.\n\n![Storefront](../../images/creating-webhook-step3.png)\n\n## Trigger the Webhook\n\nTo trigger your Webhook, you must run the following steps for each microservice:\n\n- customer\n- orders\n- inventory\n- catalog\n- auth\n- storefront-ui\n\nCreate a webhook for each microservice as shown below: \n\nFor the java applications (customer, orders, inventory, catalog, auth) use the `java-springboot2-build-deploy-pl` \nand for the applications (storefront-ui) use `nodejs-build-deploy-pl` as the pipeline.\n\n![Storefront](../../images/creating-webhook-step-4.png)\n\nYour webhooks page should look something similar as shown below:\n\n![Storefront](../../images/webhooks-storefront.png)\n\nMake a small change to trigger the pipeline such as editing the README.md file and commit to trigger a change for all microservices.\n\n![Storefront](../../images/creating-webhook-step6.png)\n\nOnce you make your changes onto your repositories you should see something as shown below: \n\n![Storefront](../../images/creating-webhook-step5.png)\n\nOnce all of your pipelines complete as shown below you can run the following command to get your url.\n\n![Storefront](../../images/pipelines-passing.png)\n\n```bash\n> oc project storefront-dev\n> oc get routes | grep \"web\"\nweb  web-storefront-dev-hk.gse-cloud-native-ocp4-fa9ee67c9ab6a7791435450358e564cc-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud web 3000-tcp  None\n```\nNow go to your browser and type in \n`web-storefront-dev-hk.gse-cloud-native-ocp4-fa9ee67c9ab6a7791435450358e564cc-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud web`\n\n\n## Result \n![Storefront](../../images/storefront-result.png)\n\n## Build and Run Storefront Mobile App\nThe storefront mobile app uses IBM Mobile Foundation services as the Mobile BFF to provide mobile security, secure connectivity to backend services, push notifications etc.\n\n### Installing IBM Mobile Foundation Services on Redhat OpenShift\nThere are multiple options to obtaining IBM Mobile Foundation and installing on a OCP cluster:-\n  - IBM CloudPak for Apps (CP4A) bundles IBM Mobile Foundation.  To install IBM Mobile Foundation from CP4A see [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCSJL_4.1.x/install-mf-cli.html)\n  - To use an existing license of IBM Mobile Foundation and deploy to OpenShift see [here](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/ibmcloud/mobilefoundation-on-openshift/)\n  - For trial and development purposes you use the Community Edition of IBM Mobile Foundation for free with the constraint that you may run only a single pod and all service data is persisted in-memory upto the lifetime of the pod.\n\n  To help you quickly get a feel of IBM Mobile Foundation integration in the Storefront application we will take you through the installation of the Community Edition.\n \n### Setup & run the Storefront Mobile App\n  - Clone the storefront mobile repo\n    ``` bash\n    > git clone git@github.com:ibm-garage-ref-storefront/storefront-mobile.git\n    > cd storefront-mobile\n    ```\n  - Deploy IBM Mobile Foundation Community Edition\n    ```bash\n    > oc project storefront-dev\n    > oc apply --recursive --filename mobilefoundation\n    > oc expose svc storefront-mf\n    ```\n  - Edit `mfpconfig/app_config.json` file and update the json object for the key `adapters` with the endpoint url of storefront auth service, clientId and secret\n  - Edit `mfpconfig/app_config.json` file and update the json object for the key `backendservices` with the appropriate endpoint urls of the storefront backend services\n  - To enable Mobile Foundation Push Notifications service for this application you must configure the service for Push Notification Credentials (FCM, APNS).  Edit `mfpconfig/app_config.json` file and update it for these credentials under json object `services.push.settings`.  To know more about what these settings and credentials are about lookup https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/notifications/sending-notifications/#setting-up-notifications    \n  - To enable push notification on Android remember to replace `google-services.json` into the directory `ionic` \n  - Edit mfpconfig/server_config.json and input the endpoint url (route), port and admin credentials for the Mobile Foundation Server\n\n    All other required configurations are already preset into `mfpconfig/app_config.json` file.  Save `mfpconfig/app_config.json` and `mfpconfig/server_config.json`\n  - Use the IBM Mobile Foundation CLI and execute the following command to configure the IBM Mobile Foundation services for the storefront app.\n    ```bash\n    > mfpdev app register\n    ```\n    You must observer the following output...\n    ```\n    Verifying server configuration...\n    Registering to server:'http://<mobile foundation endpoint url>:<port>' runtime:'mfp'\n    Registered app for platform: android\n    Registered app for platform: ios\n    ```\n    Now the IBM Mobile Foundation (the mobile BFF) is deployed, configured and running proceed further to build and run the storefront mobile application.\n  - Edit `ionic/config.xml` file and update the element `<mfp:server runtime=\"mfp\" url=\"<openshift route of mobile foundation>\" />` for the url endpoint of the Mobile Foundation server\n  - From a command-line window, navigate to the project's root folder and run the commands:\n    - `cd ionic` - to navigate to application folder\n    - `ionic cordova platform add ios` or `ionic cordova platform add android` - to add a platform.\n    - `npm install` - to install all required modules.\n    - `ionic cordova run` - to run the application.\n\n  - Run the application to view the catalog, make an order and review the user profile.  NOTE: When you place an order you will receive a push notification on your mobile app regardign the shipment of your order.\n\n    ![Storefront](../../images/mobileapp.png) \n\n\n  ","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"9e780a7e7c89f9a56c5b52059523887a","counter":113,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deploy Storefront Microservices onto Openshift","description":"Instructions to deploy on Openshift"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Deploy Storefront Microservices onto Openshift\ndescription: Instructions to deploy on Openshift\n---\n\n## Introduction\nToday you will be learning how to deploy all storefront microservices on Openshift using Tekton\n\n![Storefront Architecture](../../images/storefront.png)\n\n## Table of Contents\n  * [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)\n  * [Set Up Databases for Storefront](#set-up-databases-for-storefront)\n  * [Create an organization on Github](#create-an-organization-on-github)\n  * [Deploy Microservices to Openshift](#deploy-microservices-to-openshift)\n  * [Trigger the Webhook](#trigger-the-webhook)\n  * [Build & Run Storefront Mobile App](#build-and-run-storefront-mobile-app)\n\n## Pre-requisites \n\n+ [`Openshift`](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/welcome/index.html)\n+ [`Kabanero`](https://kabanero.io/)\n+ [`CloudPak for Apps`](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-applications)\n+ [`Docker cli`](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)\n+ [`Git cli`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n+ [`OC cli`](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/welcome/index.html)\n+ [`Tekton cli`](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli)\n+ [`gh cli`](https://cli.github.com/)\n+ [appsody](https://appsody.dev/docs/getting-started/installation)\n+ [IBM Mobile Foundation CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mfpdev-cli)\n+ [Ionic CLI Version 5.4.16](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli)\n\n## Set Up Databases for Storefront\n\nThis project will demonstrate how to deploy all the databases that are required by the storefront application.
