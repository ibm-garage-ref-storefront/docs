## Part 1: High availability and disaster recovery for applications that are based on containers

- This article is the first in a series that describes approaches and advice for developers and site
reliability engineers to build resiliency for cloud-native applications. It is based on tests that were
conducted on a sample application to determine when data might be lost or become inconsistent in
an application system failure. To make tests realistic, the sample application is BlueCompute,
which is based on a microservices architecture.

- In this article, you get familiar with the basic concepts of resiliency that you must consider when
you develop an application to meet resiliency requirements. You learn about data persistency
options, the criteria to select technology for a data store, and typical application deployment
topologies to adopt for resiliency.
- Youâ€™ll explore a few failure scenarios to understand resiliency pitfalls and the guidelines that
application developers should consider. In this context, developer is used to refer to a person who is
as either a developer or designer of applications.

## Part 2: High availability and disaster recovery for applications that are based on containers

- This article is the second in a series that describes approaches and advice for developers and site
reliability engineers to build resiliency for cloud-native applications. It is based on tests that were
conducted on a sample application to determine when data might be lost or become inconsistent in
an application system failure. To make tests realistic, the sample application is BlueCompute, which
is based on a microservices architecture.
- The first article in this series discussed a few key concepts of resiliency along the following domains:
  - Technologies: storage types, databases
  - Architecture topologies: single cluster, multi cluster, multiple sites, site status (activestandby)
  - Data consistency features: ACID and BASE databases, CAP theorem

- In this article, you explore a few failure scenarios to understand resiliency pitfalls that are common
in developing a microservices application. Then, you learn guidelines that are important for
application developers to consider to build applications that can be deployed securely with resiliency
capabilities. In this context, developer is used to refer to a person who is as either a developer or
designer of applications.
